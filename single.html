                                        <p>Organizing events can be hard. Be it the smallest parties or meetings, to much larger conventions, ceremonies and even trade shows, every event has to have proper thought and organization if it has to be executed properly. And that’s where you’ll find the Event Industry. It’s a broad definition of a field that includes planning, managing a wide range of occasions as well as the execution of these events. This happens with a wide array of personnel from various organizations collaborating together to create an experience that the sponsors, hosts and attendees will love and remember for a long time.  </p>

                                        </blockquote>
                                        <h4>Event Planners</h4>
                                        <p>The Event Planner is the brains behind the project. They are usually the ones tasked with designing the concepts and themes of the event in order to execute the objectives of the host. They also are responsible for picking a budget, a venue, the timeline, catering and a host of other services that go into an event. They also have to figure out the logistics and marketing of the event.</p>
                                        <h4>Event Managers </h4>
                                        <p>While the planners are the ones who come up with the concepts, the Event Managers are the ones who are in charge of the actual implementation of the plans. They are the ones supervising all the operations from the contractors to the staff. They are also the one who will have to deal with any issues that may appear while the event is going on</p>
                                        <h4>Event Coordinators </h4>
                                        <p>The Event coordinators act as the assistants to the event managers and planners. They are usually put in charge of details like handling the registration and accommodation and at times transportation as well. They are the ones who usually are in constant contact with the venue, caterers and entertainers/speakers.</p>                                     
                                        
                                        <h4>Event Marketers </h4>
                                        <p>The name really says it all. These are the individuals tasked with the promotion and advertising of the occasion in order to draw their target market. This can be done in quite a few ways/ For example, they could use social media, email marketing, websites and posters. In the current day and age, it’s also possible to target paid ads as well. Event Marketers will also have to evaluate their marketing campaigns as well.</p>                                     
                                        
                                        <h4>Event Designers </h4>
                                        <p>Every event has it’s own unique visual aesthetic and event designers are the ones responsible for crafting and implementing that aesthetic to the event. The layouts, decorations, sound, lighting and the signage have to be overseen by the designer and they have to remain consistent with the original theme and concept of the event.</p>                                     
                                        
                                        <h4>Event Producers</h4>
                                        <p>An Event Producer is typically the person that fills in the meat of the event. They are the ones creating the program of the event. They are able to produce content like speeches, presentations or even videos. They can also go the interactive route depending on the event and organize games and quizzes as well.</p>

                                        <p>It should be noted that some of the time certain individuals may fill out more than one role depending on the scale of the event.</p>

                                            <h3>What’s The Current State of The Event Industry?</h3>
                                            <p>Well, it’s a bit complicated.The world has changed after the COVID-19 pandemic. And the event industry has been forced to adapt along with it. With new technology and the expectations of the public changing along with increased competition innovating every step of the way, lets take a look at the event industry today.</p>
                                            <h4>COVID-19- The Impact and Aftermath</h4>
                                            <p>The pandemic has had an extremely negative impact on the event industry. Many events were either postponed or cancelled. And at a later stage introduced into virtual or hybrid settings. Surveys have shown that 96% of event organizers had to undergo cancellations and many expected their businesses to take a significant hit within the next 12 months. </p>
                                        </blockquote>
                                        <h4>Adopting New Technology</h4>
                                        <p> As a byproduct of the pandemic, technologies to increase the safety of events along with their efficiency have seen a remarkable rate of adoption. Contactless check ins, thorough health screenings, the introduction of social distancing and even digital badges are commonplace in our current environment.</p>
                                        <p>This has also lead to the adoption of completely virtual or hybrid events. Trends like live streaming that were used commonly in fields such as video gaming or blogging became extremely popular. And then with hybrid events, organizers sought to combine online and physical elements to create unique and interactive experiences.  Online platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, MS Teams and Skype saw their stock rise rapidly in just a couple of years, enabling organizers to appeal to a  wide range of consumers minus travel or environmental costs.</p>
                                        <p>Some of the other technologies used to enhance the quality of an event by giving them more convenience, entertainment and interaction are Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Biometrics, drones and even chat bots.</p>
                                        <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                                            <h4>Audience Engagement</h4>
                                            <p>Another important aspect to emerge from the post Covid-19 event industry is the focus on audience engagement. This is the how much an audience will be able to be involved, be interested and be satisfied with the event. This will affect the attendees loyalty to that event as well. It is a crucial element to make an event a memorable occaision. This is usually done through social media, polls, surveys and Q&A sessions and giving incentives.</p>
                                            <p>The event industry is a field that is incredibly diverse and requires you to have a multitude of skills like the ability to organize, effectively communicate and a whole load of teamwork as well. But this industry can also offer quite the number of opportunities in the form of travel and fun while also allowing you to learn and network.  And right now it is in the middle of an evolution where new technologies are rising fast as this bright industry adapts and changes to meet a whole new future.</p>
